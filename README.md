# AZ-Covid19BasicGraph
By using Python, I have plotted a fundamental graph that shows the COVID-19 cases in Arizona each month. Whenever it runs, the program provides the newest statistics based on the NYTimes public data. Also, the graph tells you the slope of total cases as well as deaths in Arizona each month since January 2020.
